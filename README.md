# Intro
This is A 64x64 programming game made for [LowRezJam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2020). The instructions of the game are included in this file, since I didn't have time to figure out how to fit them into a 64px square view. 

## Welcome to DIGICODE

Once you pass the main menu and select the first level, you'll see the following advanced mission command system:

<full view>

This is DIGICODE. The mostly-empty larger view under the rows of slots shows the map:

<map view>

You can see our drone in the bottom left, as well as the path to the target which is in light green. Your task is to guide this drone to the target. However, you are a highly intelligent being, with highly abstract tools. The top view display shows your controls:

<control view>
  
And each 3x5 color-coded group of slots is a _function_. Each function contains 15 slots, and each slot can hold 1 instruction. Your task is to guide your drone to the target by placing instructions into these slots. Clicking on a slot will open the instruction menu:

<instruction menu>
  
Which displays all available instructions. The first three--blue, grey, and green are for basic movement. Blue will move the drone forward, grey will turn left, and green will turn right.
